# Geminim

Geminim is a small server using the [gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) written in the Nim programming language.

## Features
* Lightweight
* Simple .ini configuration
* Name-based vhosting support

### Planned features:
* Client TLS-certificate
* INPUT support


**Note:** This is my first serious attempt at coding a server. Help and criticism is always welcome :D
